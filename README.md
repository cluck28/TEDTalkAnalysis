# TEDTalkAnalysis
Analysis of TED talk attributes to predict highly viewed talks. NLP done to analyze some content of the most and least viewed talks. See christopherluciuk.ca for more details.

The dataset contains a number of features including the speaker, related tags, related talks, number of comments, and number of views. It also contains the transcripts for each talk. 

The purpose of this exploration was to try to train an algorithm to predict which talks would be highly viewed (view count above the mean view count). Feature engineering and various classification tools were used to determine the most useful parameters to train with. 

Subsequent work explored NLP and the content of the most and least viewed TED talk in the dataset. This work is still ongoing.
